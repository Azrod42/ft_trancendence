In ft_transcendence, we are tasked with developing a web application using the full technology stack, in our case **NextJS**  (react), **NestJS**  and **PostgresSQL**.

The main goal of ft_transcendence is to create an online gaming platform that allows users to play a real-time "Pong" game. However, the project goes beyond just implementing the game by adding additional features such as:

- OAuth2 42
- Real-time communication between players *(private chat and group chat)*
- User profile and management *(player stats, add friend, change displayname...)*
- Matchmaking *(ranked, unranked, custom games)*
- Live information *(users connected, friend status ... )*

This project serves as an excellent opportunity  to put our full-stack development skills into practice, learn to work as a team, and tackle technical challenges associated with building a complex web application. It also provides valuable experience in real-time application development, which can be applicable in various fields of computer science.
